# Practice Web Portfolio (HTML & CSS)

## Overview

This project is a practice web portfolio created using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a front-end exercise to build and improve skills in web design and responsive layouts. The portfolio showcases a sample design and is not based on any real individual's work. It's intended for learning purposes and experimenting with different HTML structures and CSS styling techniques.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using CSS media queries.
* **Clean and Minimalist Design:** Focuses on a simple and easy-to-navigate structure.
* **Showcases Basic Portfolio Sections:** Includes sections for an introduction, projects, and contact information (though the functionality is primarily visual).
* **Built with Semantic HTML:** Uses appropriate HTML5 tags for better structure and SEO.
* **Styled with CSS:** All visual styling is done using CSS, demonstrating various layout and styling properties.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Usage

You can explore the code to understand how the different sections are structured and styled. Feel free to clone or fork this repository and modify it for your own learning or practice projects. You can experiment with different layouts, colors, typography, and add more sections or interactive elements (though the latter would likely require JavaScript, which is not part of this practice project).
